# Backend API and Debugging Explanation

This document explains the flow, logic, and debugging approach for each backend route in your `server.js`, with references to the models and how the backend responds to the frontend. It is written for beginners who want to understand how a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend works in a real project.

---

## 1. Project Structure Overview

- **Express**: Web server framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
- **Models**: Represent MongoDB collections (tables). Example: `User`, `Employee`, `Task`, `Permission`.
- **Routes**: API endpoints (URLs) that frontend calls to get or update data.
- **Controllers**: (In some projects) Functions that handle the logic for each route.

---

## 2. How Backend Responds to Frontend

- The frontend (React) makes HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend API endpoints.
- The backend receives the request, processes it (fetches/updates data in MongoDB), and sends a JSON response.
- The frontend uses this response to update the UI.

---

## 3. Debugging Approach

- **Console Logs**: Use `console.log()` to print variables and flow in the backend.
- **Error Handling**: Use `try/catch` blocks. If an error occurs, send a response with `res.status(500).json({ error: ... })`.
- **Testing**: Use tools like Postman or your frontend to test API endpoints.
- **Check MongoDB**: Use MongoDB Compass or `mongo` shell to see if data is stored as expected.

## 4. Route-by-Route Explanation

### /permissions/:userId (POST, GET)

- **Model**: `Permission` (fields: userId, operations)
- **userId**: The MongoDB ObjectId of the user (from `User` collection).
- **operations**: An array or object describing what actions the user can perform (e.g., ['read', 'write']).
- **POST**: Create or update permissions for a user.
  - If a Permission for userId exists, update it. Otherwise, create a new one.
- **GET**: Fetch permissions for a user by userId.
- **How it works**: Used to control what features a user can access in the frontend.

### /employees (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)

- **Model**: `Employee`
- **GET**: Fetch all employees or a single employee by name or id.
- **POST**: Add a new employee.
- **DELETE**: Remove an employee and all related data (salary increments, tasks).
- **PUT**: Update employee details or role.
- **How it works**: Used for employee management in the HR system.

### /task (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)

- **Model**: `Task`
- **GET**: Fetch all tasks or tasks for a specific employee.
- **POST**: Add a new task for an employee.
- **PUT**: Update task status (start, pause, complete) and calculate rating.
- **DELETE**: Remove a task.
- **How it works**: Used for task assignment and tracking.

### /task/ratings/weekly/:employeeName

- **Logic**: Fetch all tasks for the employee in the last 7 days. Group by weekday. Calculate average rating and task count for each day.
- **Frontend**: Used to show weekly performance chart.

### /task/ratings/monthly/:employeeName

- **Logic**: Fetch all tasks for the employee in the current year. Group by month. Calculate average rating and task count for each month.
- **Frontend**: Used to show monthly performance chart.

### /task/ratings/weekly and /task/ratings/monthly (no employeeName)

- **Logic**: Fetch all tasks for all employees. Group by day (weekly) or month (monthly). For each employee, calculate average rating for each period.
- **Frontend**: Used for admin/HR dashboards to compare employees.

## 5. How to Debug

1. **Check the request in the frontend**: What URL is being called? What data is sent?
2. **Check the backend route**: Is the route implemented? Is it receiving the correct data?
3. **Add console logs**: Print incoming data, query results, and errors.
4. **Check MongoDB**: Is the data being saved/updated as expected?
5. **Check the response**: Is the backend sending the expected JSON?
6. **Check the frontend**: Is it using the response correctly?

---

## 6. Example: Permissions Flow

- When a user logs in, their userId is known.
- The frontend may call `/permissions/:userId` to get what actions the user can do.
- The backend checks the `Permission` model for that userId and returns the allowed operations.
- The frontend uses this to enable/disable features.

---

## 7. Example: Task Completion and Rating

- When a task is completed, the frontend calls `/task/complete/:id` with the time taken.
- The backend calculates the rating based on how fast the task was done (compared to the target duration).
- The task is updated in MongoDB with the new rating.
- The frontend fetches updated ratings for charts.

---

## 8. General Tips for Beginners

- Always check the backend logs for errors.
- Use Postman to test endpoints without the frontend.
- Read the model files to understand what fields are stored.
- Use `console.log()` to trace the flow.
- If something is not updating in the UI, check if the backend is sending the right data.

---

## 9. How to Extend or Change

- To add a new feature, create a new route and update the model if needed.
- To change what data is sent, update the response in the route handler.
- To debug, add logs and check both backend and frontend.

This document should help you understand the flow, logic, and debugging process for your backend. As you gain experience, youâ€™ll be able to add more features and debug more complex issues!
